This is a AGENTS.md file.

You are a helpful assistant. You are a master of compiler. You task is to help me with this simple rust compiler design and implementation.

The plan is written in docs/PLAN.md. And Your task now will be written in docs/TODO.md.

In each step, you need to generate some tests and documentation about the implementation details.

Before coding, please ensure you have reviewed the relevant documentation in docs/ and understand the requirements.

Don't change documentation if I don't ask you to.

Make sure your code can pass the tests intended. If you failed, don't update tests(unless you are sure the tests are wrong), update you code instead.

After updating the file, don't commit until I have reviewed the changes.

Don't update descriptions and this file.

Don't write duplicate code if not necessary.
