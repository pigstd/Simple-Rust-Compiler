This is a documentation file for every module in the Simple Rust Compiler project.

For each directory in the `include` and `src` folders, there should be a corresponding directory in the `docs` folder.

For example, the `include/ast` directory should have a corresponding `docs/ast` directory.

For each module in the `include` and `src` folders, there should be a corresponding documentation file in the `docs` folder.

For example, for `include/ast/visitor.h` and `src/ast/visitor.cpp`, there should be a corresponding `docs/ast/visitor.md` file.

Each documentation should contain:

- A brief description of the module's purpose and functionality.
- Detailed descriptions of each function, class(include enum class) and using statements, including its parameters, return values, effects, and usage examples.
- Some details about the implementation for certain functions or classes, depending on the complexity of the module.
